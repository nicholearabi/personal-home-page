            <strong>Where I come from !?</strong>
            <br>
            My name is Elham, but I also go by the nickname Nichole. I am originally from Iran and currently living in
            Manchester. However, I spent nearly eight years living in Sweden, where I learned to speak Swedish fluently.
            My first language is Persian-Farsi, but I am also proficient in English. I enjoy learning about new cultures
            and meeting new people.
            <br>
            I am passionate about various activities in life, including engaging in physical exercise, challenging my
            mind with puzzles, expressing my creativity through photography and design, and expanding my knowledge
            through studying.
            <br>
            To me, coding is exhilarating as it provides a chance to enhance one's mental capacity and get involved in
            diverse forms of creation
